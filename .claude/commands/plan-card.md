description: Read a Jira card and develop a plan
---

You have access to Jira CLI. We're working on $1 in the Marketable Tools Jira space. The Jira command for viewing an issue is `jira view  $1`. Prepare an implementation plan for this card and save it in /specs/$2-claude.md . The implementation plan should start by creating a branch called $1 and end by creating a PR, then when the PR has been approved by a human, squashing and merging that PR. You and I will collaborate on this plan. Do not make any other changes until I have approved the plan.
