We're working on implementing Phase 3.1 in @specs\2025-11-06T11-08-00-mvp-phase-3-admin.md . The previous developer left a summary of completed work in @docs\Phase_3.1_Summary.md saying the work was completed, but this is incorrect. We have problems we need to resolve.

@src\app\admin\page.tsx has an <h1>, a welcome message, an error display, and a Metrics Cards Grid. I see none of that on the dashboard in the browser.
