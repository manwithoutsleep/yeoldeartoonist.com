# Implementation Plan: Issue #33 - Show Full Uncropped Images for Projects and Events

**Issue:** #33
**Title:** Show each Project and Event with the full, uncropped image
**Created:** 2025-11-30T13:01:39
**Branch:** issue-33

---

## Overview

### Summary

Currently, the "In The Works" page (`src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx`) displays Projects and Events in a 2-column grid (on wide screens) with images cropped to fit a fixed `h-48` (192px) container using `object-cover`. The images are positioned above the text content. This implementation plan changes the layout to:

1. Display **one Project or Event per row** on wide screens (instead of 2-per-row)
2. Position the **image to the left** of the text on wide screens
3. Show the **full, uncropped image** in its original aspect ratio
4. Constrain images to **400px height on wide screens** with variable width
5. On mobile, keep images **above the text**, constrained to container width with variable height

### Goals and Success Criteria

**Goals:**

- Improve user experience by showing full, uncropped images
- Create a more spacious, gallery-like layout for Projects and Events
- Maintain responsive design principles for mobile and desktop

**Success Criteria:**

- ✅ Images display in their original aspect ratio (no cropping)
- ✅ Wide screens: 1 item per row, image on left (400px height, variable width)
- ✅ Mobile: image above text, full container width, variable height
- ✅ All existing tests pass with updated layout expectations
- ✅ No TypeScript, ESLint, or Prettier errors
- ✅ Visual regression testing confirms layout matches requirements

### Estimated Scope and Complexity

**Complexity:** Low to Medium

**Rationale:**

- The change is primarily CSS/Tailwind-based layout modification
- Component structure remains largely the same (server component)
- Database schema requires no changes
- Image URLs are already stored in the database
- Next.js `<Image>` component already supports aspect ratio preservation
- Main work: refactoring grid layout and Image component properties
- Testing updates will be straightforward (updating class name assertions)

**Files to Modify:**

1. `src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx` - Main layout changes
2. `__tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx` - Update test assertions

---

## Technical Approach

### Architectural Decisions and Rationale

#### 1. **CSS Grid to Flexbox Transition**

- **Decision:** Change from `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` to a single-column layout with flexbox for horizontal alignment on desktop
- **Rationale:** Flexbox provides better control for side-by-side layouts with variable-width images
- **SOLID Principle:** Single Responsibility - Each layout section (Projects, Events) has one clear presentation pattern

#### 2. **Responsive Image Constraints**

- **Decision:** Use Next.js `<Image>` with explicit width/height to preserve aspect ratio
- **Rationale:**
    - Setting `width` and `height` props (based on intrinsic dimensions) prevents layout shift
    - Remove `fill` and `object-cover` which crops images
    - CSS constraints (`max-h-[400px]` on desktop, `w-full` on mobile) maintain size limits
- **SOLID Principle:** Open/Closed - Image component is extended with new sizing behavior without modifying Next.js internals

#### 3. **Conditional Rendering for Desktop vs Mobile**

- **Decision:** Use Tailwind responsive classes (`md:flex-row`, `flex-col`) to switch layouts
- **Rationale:** Tailwind's mobile-first approach makes responsive design declarative and maintainable
- **SOLID Principle:** Interface Segregation - Layout concerns are separated via responsive utility classes

#### 4. **Preserve Image Aspect Ratio**

- **Decision:** Use `object-contain` instead of `object-cover` and allow container to flex
- **Rationale:** `object-contain` ensures the full image is visible without cropping
- **SOLID Principle:** Dependency Inversion - We depend on the abstraction of "preserve aspect ratio" rather than specific cropping behavior

### Design Patterns to Be Used

1. **Container/Presentational Pattern:** The page remains a presentational component with data fetching at the top
2. **Responsive Design Pattern:** Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-based layout changes
3. **Component Composition:** Separate sections for Projects and Events with consistent internal structure

### Integration Points with Existing Code

- **Database Queries:** No changes required to `getAllProjects()` or `getUpcomingEvents()`
- **Image URLs:** Continue using `image_url` field from database
- **TypeScript Types:** Existing `ProjectRow` and `EventRow` types remain unchanged
- **Styling:** Uses existing Tailwind configuration

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk                                                                              | Impact | Mitigation                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Images with extreme aspect ratios (very wide or very tall) create awkward layouts | Medium | Test with various aspect ratios; consider max-width constraints if needed        |
| Performance impact from larger images                                             | Low    | Next.js Image component handles optimization; already using `revalidate` for ISR |
| Browser compatibility for flexbox responsive behavior                             | Low    | Flexbox has excellent browser support; test in target browsers                   |
| Broken layout if image_url is missing                                             | Low    | Existing conditional rendering handles missing images                            |

### SOLID Principles Application

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
    - Each section (Projects, Events) has a single responsibility: display its content type
    - Layout logic is separated from data fetching logic
    - Image display logic is encapsulated within its container

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
    - Page is open for extension (can add new sections) but closed for modification
    - Image sizing approach is extended without modifying core Image component

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
    - Not directly applicable (no inheritance), but component behavior remains consistent
    - Projects and Events can be rendered interchangeably with the same layout pattern

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
    - Layout concerns are segregated via responsive utility classes
    - Desktop and mobile layouts are defined separately

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
    - Component depends on database query abstractions (`getAllProjects`, `getUpcomingEvents`)
    - Image display depends on Next.js Image abstraction, not specific browser APIs

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Branch

**Task:** Create feature branch for issue #33

```bash
git checkout -b issue-33
```

**Verification:** None required (git operation)

---

### Step 2: Write Failing Layout Tests (TDD Red Phase)

**Task:** Add new test cases that verify the updated layout structure before implementation

**Files to Modify:**

- `__tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx`

**Test Cases to Add:**

1. **Test: Projects should display in single-column layout on desktop**
    - Assert the grid container no longer has `md:grid-cols-2`
    - Assert single-column layout structure

2. **Test: Project images should use object-contain instead of object-cover**
    - Assert image has `object-contain` class
    - Assert image does not have `object-cover` class

3. **Test: Event images should use object-contain instead of object-cover**
    - Assert image has `object-contain` class
    - Assert image does not have `object-cover` class

4. **Test: Desktop layout should position image to the left of content**
    - Assert flexbox row layout on desktop (`md:flex-row`)
    - Assert mobile keeps column layout (`flex-col`)

5. **Test: Images should have max-height constraint on desktop**
    - Assert image container has `md:max-h-[400px]` class

**Rationale:** These tests define the new layout behavior and will fail until implementation

**SOLID Application:**

- SRP: Each test verifies one specific layout behavior
- DIP: Tests depend on CSS class abstractions, not implementation details

**Verification Process:**

```bash
# Run TypeScript check (should pass - only tests changed)
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run ESLint on test file
npx eslint --fix __tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx

# Run Prettier on test file
npx prettier --write __tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx

# Run tests (should FAIL - Red phase)
npx vitest related run __tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx
```

**Expected Outcome:** New tests should FAIL (Red phase of TDD)

---

### Step 3: Implement Layout Changes (TDD Green Phase)

**Task:** Modify the "In The Works" page to implement the new layout

**Files to Modify:**

- `src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx`

**Changes:**

#### A. Update Projects Section (lines 58-116)

**Before (current code):**

```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
    {projects.map((project) => (
        <div
            key={project.id}
            className="border-2 border-black rounded overflow-hidden"
        >
            {project.image_url && (
                <div className="relative w-full h-48 overflow-hidden bg-gray-100">
                    <Image
                        src={project.image_url}
                        alt={`${project.title}${project.description ? ': ' + project.description : ''}`}
                        fill
                        className="object-cover"
                    />
                </div>
            )}
            <div className="p-6">{/* Content */}</div>
        </div>
    ))}
</div>
```

**After (new code):**

```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col gap-8">
    {projects.map((project) => (
        <div
            key={project.id}
            className="border-2 border-black rounded overflow-hidden flex flex-col md:flex-row"
        >
            {project.image_url && (
                <div className="relative bg-gray-100 flex-shrink-0 w-full md:w-auto md:max-h-[400px]">
                    <Image
                        src={project.image_url}
                        alt={`${project.title}${project.description ? ': ' + project.description : ''}`}
                        width={800}
                        height={600}
                        className="object-contain w-full h-auto md:h-full md:w-auto"
                    />
                </div>
            )}
            <div className="p-6 flex-1">{/* Content remains the same */}</div>
        </div>
    ))}
</div>
```

**Key Changes:**

- Grid container → Flex column container
- Card uses flexbox: `flex flex-col md:flex-row` (mobile: column, desktop: row)
- Image container: `flex-shrink-0 w-full md:w-auto md:max-h-[400px]`
- Image: Remove `fill`, add `width={800} height={600}` (placeholder values, actual aspect ratio preserved)
- Image classes: `object-contain w-full h-auto md:h-full md:w-auto`
- Content div: Add `flex-1` to take remaining space

#### B. Update Events Section (lines 132-238)

Apply the same structural changes as Projects section:

```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col gap-8">
    {events.map((event) => (
        <div
            key={event.id}
            className="border-2 border-black rounded overflow-hidden flex flex-col md:flex-row"
        >
            {event.image_url && (
                <div className="relative bg-gray-100 flex-shrink-0 w-full md:w-auto md:max-h-[400px]">
                    <Image
                        src={event.image_url}
                        alt={`${event.title}${event.description ? ': ' + event.description : ''}`}
                        width={800}
                        height={600}
                        className="object-contain w-full h-auto md:h-full md:w-auto"
                    />
                </div>
            )}
            <div className="p-6 flex-1">{/* Content remains the same */}</div>
        </div>
    ))}
</div>
```

**Rationale:**

- `flex-col md:flex-row`: Mobile stacks vertically, desktop shows side-by-side
- `w-full md:w-auto`: Mobile uses full width, desktop auto-sizes based on image
- `md:max-h-[400px]`: Desktop constrains height to 400px
- `object-contain`: Shows full image without cropping
- `width={800} height={600}`: Placeholder intrinsic dimensions (Next.js preserves actual aspect ratio)

**SOLID Application:**

- SRP: Layout logic is separated and consistent across sections
- OCP: Extended layout without breaking existing functionality
- ISP: Responsive concerns are segregated via breakpoints

**Verification Process:**

```bash
# Run TypeScript check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run ESLint
npx eslint --fix src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx

# Run Prettier
npx prettier --write src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx

# Run tests (should PASS - Green phase)
npx vitest related run src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx
```

**Expected Outcome:** Tests should now PASS (Green phase of TDD)

---

### Step 4: Refactor and Optimize (TDD Refactor Phase)

**Task:** Review implementation for opportunities to improve code quality while keeping tests passing

**Refactoring Opportunities:**

1. **Extract Image Container Component (Optional)**
    - Consider creating a reusable `<ResponsiveImageContainer>` if this pattern is used elsewhere
    - For now, inline is acceptable given Single Responsibility is maintained

2. **Consolidate Repeated Code**
    - Projects and Events sections have identical structure
    - Could extract a reusable `<ContentCard>` component in future refactoring
    - Not required for this issue, but document as technical debt

3. **Optimize Image Dimensions**
    - Replace placeholder `width={800} height={600}` with actual image dimensions if available
    - Could add image metadata to database schema in future enhancement
    - For now, Next.js handles aspect ratio correctly

**SOLID Application:**

- SRP: Each potential extracted component would have single responsibility
- OCP: Future component extraction wouldn't modify existing page logic

**Verification Process:**

```bash
# Re-run all verification steps after refactoring
npx tsc --noEmit
npx eslint --fix src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx
npx prettier --write src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx
npx vitest related run src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx
```

**Expected Outcome:** All tests still pass after refactoring

---

### Step 5: Update Test Assertions

**Task:** Update existing test cases to match new layout structure

**Files to Modify:**

- `__tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx`

**Test Updates Required:**

1. **Update "should display project image" test (line 177-194)**
    - Update to verify `object-contain` instead of `object-cover`
    - Verify image is not using `fill` prop

2. **Update "should display event image" test (line 352-369)**
    - Update to verify `object-contain` instead of `object-cover`
    - Verify image is not using `fill` prop

3. **Add responsive layout test**
    - Verify flex-col on mobile, flex-row on desktop
    - Verify max-height constraint on desktop

**Verification Process:**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npx eslint --fix __tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx
npx prettier --write __tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx
npx vitest related run __tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx
```

**Expected Outcome:** All tests pass with 100% coverage maintained

---

### Step 6: Manual Visual Testing

**Task:** Perform manual testing to verify layout matches requirements

**Manual Testing Scenarios:**

1. **Desktop Layout (Wide Screen ≥768px)**
    - [ ] Navigate to `/in-the-works` in browser
    - [ ] Verify Projects display one per row
    - [ ] Verify Project images appear to the left of text
    - [ ] Verify images are not cropped (full image visible)
    - [ ] Verify images are constrained to approximately 400px height
    - [ ] Verify image aspect ratio is preserved
    - [ ] Repeat for Events section

2. **Mobile Layout (Screen <768px)**
    - [ ] Resize browser to mobile width or use device emulator
    - [ ] Verify Project images appear above text
    - [ ] Verify images take full container width
    - [ ] Verify images scale height to maintain aspect ratio
    - [ ] Repeat for Events section

3. **Edge Cases**
    - [ ] Test with very wide image (e.g., panorama)
    - [ ] Test with very tall image (e.g., portrait)
    - [ ] Test with square image
    - [ ] Test with missing image (verify graceful degradation)

4. **Cross-Browser Testing**
    - [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
    - [ ] Firefox
    - [ ] Safari (if available)

**Test Data Setup:**

- Use existing database entries or create test projects/events with various image aspect ratios
- Recommended: Add at least one wide, one tall, and one square image for comprehensive testing

**Verification Process:**

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/in-the-works
# Perform manual tests above
```

**Expected Outcome:** All manual tests pass, layout matches AC

---

### Step 7: Run Full Build and Verification Suite

**Task:** Ensure all code quality checks pass before requesting review

**Verification Process:**

```bash
# Run full verification suite
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm test
npm run build
```

**Expected Outcome:** All checks pass with no errors or warnings

**Failure Handling:**

- If TypeScript errors: Fix type issues, re-run `npx tsc --noEmit`
- If ESLint errors: Run `npm run lint` and fix issues
- If format errors: Run `npm run format` and commit changes
- If tests fail: Debug test failures, fix issues, re-run tests
- If build fails: Check Next.js build output, fix issues

**3-Attempt Rule:** If any verification step fails more than 3 times, stop and escalate to human for guidance

---

### Step 8: Request Human Review

**Task:** Present all changes for human review before creating PR

**Review Checklist:**

- [ ] All code changes are complete
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] All verification commands pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed successfully
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Layout matches acceptance criteria

**Deliverables:**

1. Modified files:
    - `src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx`
    - `__tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx`
2. Test results summary
3. Manual testing results
4. Screenshots showing before/after (optional but recommended)

**Questions for Review:**

- Does the layout match the visual design expectations?
- Are there any edge cases we should handle differently?
- Should we extract a reusable component for the image container?
- Are the placeholder image dimensions (800x600) acceptable?

---

### Step 9: Create Pull Request

**Task:** Create a pull request with comprehensive description

**PR Title:**

```
Fix: Show full uncropped images for Projects and Events (#33)
```

**PR Description Template:**

```markdown

### Step 10: After PR Approval - Squash and Merge

**Task:** Merge the approved PR into main branch

**Merge Strategy:** Squash and merge (preferred for clean commit history)

**Verification Process:**

```bash
# Merge PR (after approval)
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

**Post-Merge:**

- [ ] Verify PR is merged
- [ ] Verify branch is deleted
- [ ] Verify deployment pipeline succeeds (if applicable)
- [ ] Close issue #33

---

## Verification Process

After **EACH** implementation step (Steps 2-7), follow this verification procedure:

### Verification Commands

```bash
# 1. TypeScript compile check (always run as-is)
npx tsc --noEmit

# 2. ESLint (replace {files} with modified file paths)
npx eslint --fix {files}

# 3. Prettier (replace {files} with modified file paths)
npx prettier --write {files}

# 4. Vitest (replace {files} with modified file paths)
npx vitest related run {files}
```

### File Path Substitution

Replace `{files}` with space-separated file paths modified in the current step:

**Example for Step 2:**

```bash
npx eslint --fix __tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx
npx prettier --write __tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx
npx vitest related run __tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx
```

**Example for Step 3:**

```bash
npx eslint --fix src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx
npx prettier --write src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx
npx vitest related run src/app/in-the-works/page.tsx
```

### Verification Failure Handling

1. Run verification commands after completing the step
2. If any command fails:
    - Fix the specific error
    - Re-run the failing verification command
3. Track attempts (max 3 attempts per step)
4. If failures persist beyond 3 attempts:
    - **STOP implementation**
    - Document the issue and error details
    - Ask human for guidance
5. Only proceed to next step when **ALL** verifications pass

### Rationale

This verification process ensures:

- Code compiles without TypeScript errors
- Code follows ESLint and Prettier standards
- Tests pass at each stage (TDD compliance)
- Issues are caught early and fixed immediately
- No accumulation of technical debt

---

## Testing Strategy

### TDD Approach

This implementation follows Test-Driven Development:

1. **Red Phase:** Write failing tests that define desired behavior (Step 2)
2. **Green Phase:** Implement minimum code to pass tests (Step 3)
3. **Refactor Phase:** Improve code quality while keeping tests passing (Step 4)

### Unit Tests to Write FIRST (Step 2)

#### Test File: `__tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx`

**New Test Cases:**

1. **Test: Projects use single-column layout**

    ```typescript
    it('should display projects in single-column layout', async () => {
        // Verify no multi-column grid classes
    });
    ```

2. **Test: Project images use object-contain**

    ```typescript
    it('should display project images with object-contain', async () => {
        // Assert object-contain class present
        // Assert object-cover class absent
    });
    ```

3. **Test: Event images use object-contain**

    ```typescript
    it('should display event images with object-contain', async () => {
        // Assert object-contain class present
        // Assert object-cover class absent
    });
    ```

4. **Test: Desktop layout uses flex-row**

    ```typescript
    it('should position images to the left on desktop', async () => {
        // Assert md:flex-row class present
    });
    ```

5. **Test: Mobile layout uses flex-col**

    ```typescript
    it('should position images above text on mobile', async () => {
        // Assert flex-col class present
    });
    ```

6. **Test: Image height constraint on desktop**
    ```typescript
    it('should constrain image height to 400px on desktop', async () => {
        // Assert md:max-h-[400px] class present
    });
    ```

### Integration Tests Required

**Scope:** Not required for this change (layout-only modification)

Future consideration: E2E tests with Playwright to verify responsive behavior in real browsers

### Manual Testing Scenarios (Step 6)

See Step 6 for comprehensive manual testing checklist covering:

- Desktop layout verification
- Mobile layout verification
- Edge cases (various aspect ratios)
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Test Data Requirements

**Existing Data:** Use current database entries via mocked `getAllProjects()` and `getUpcomingEvents()`

**Manual Testing Data:**

- Create test projects/events with:
    - Wide landscape image (e.g., 1600x600)
    - Tall portrait image (e.g., 600x1200)
    - Square image (e.g., 800x800)
    - Missing image (null `image_url`)

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Target:** Maintain existing 100% coverage for modified files
- **Focus:** Ensure all layout variations are covered (desktop/mobile, with/without images)
- **Regression:** All existing tests must continue to pass

### Regression Tests

All existing tests in `__tests__/app/in-the-works/page.test.tsx` must pass after changes:

- Projects section tests
- Events section tests
- Error handling tests

## Considerations

### Security Implications

**Assessment:** Low Risk

- No user input handling changes
- No authentication/authorization changes
- Image URLs come from trusted database (admin-uploaded)
- Next.js Image component provides built-in security (XSS protection via sanitized src)

**Considerations:**

- Ensure image URLs remain server-validated (already implemented in admin panel)
- No new attack vectors introduced

### Performance Impacts

**Assessment:** Neutral to Slight Improvement

**Analysis:**

- **Image Loading:** Next.js Image component handles optimization (WebP, responsive sizes)
- **Layout Performance:** Flexbox is highly performant
- **Revalidation:** Existing ISR strategy (`revalidate: 3600`) unchanged
- **Bundle Size:** No new dependencies

**Potential Improvements:**

- Larger images may load (full size vs cropped), but Next.js serves appropriately sized variants
- Single-column layout reduces initial viewport content (faster FCP)

**Monitoring:**

- Monitor Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) for image loading
- Test with Lighthouse for performance regressions

### Database Migrations

**Required:** None

**Rationale:**

- Existing `image_url` field in `projects` and `events` tables is sufficient
- No schema changes needed
- No new fields required

**Future Consideration:**

- Could add `image_width` and `image_height` fields for exact aspect ratio preservation
- Not required for current implementation (Next.js infers from actual images)

### Backward Compatibility

**Assessment:** Fully Compatible

**Analysis:**

- Layout change is purely presentational
- No API changes
- No breaking changes to database schema
- Existing admin panel continues to work unchanged
- Image URLs remain in the same format

**Migration:** None required

### Documentation Updates Needed

**Files to Update:**

1. **CLAUDE.md (Optional)**
    - Document responsive layout pattern if it becomes reusable
    - No update required for this single-page change

2. **Component Documentation (Optional)**
    - Add JSDoc comments to page component explaining layout approach
    - Document responsive breakpoint strategy

**Recommended Documentation:**

```typescript
/**
 * In The Works page - Display projects and upcoming events
 *
 * Layout:
 * - Desktop (≥768px): Single-column with image on left (400px height, auto width)
 * - Mobile (<768px): Stacked layout with image above text (full width, auto height)
 *
 * Images are displayed in their original aspect ratio using object-contain
 */
```

## Summary

This implementation plan addresses GitHub Issue #33 by:

1. **Changing the layout** from a 2-column grid to a single-column responsive layout
2. **Displaying full images** using `object-contain` instead of cropped images with `object-cover`
3. **Implementing responsive behavior:**
    - Desktop: Image left, text right, 400px height constraint
    - Mobile: Image above, text below, full-width constraint
4. **Following TDD practices** with Red-Green-Refactor cycle
5. **Applying SOLID principles** throughout the implementation
6. **Ensuring code quality** with verification at each step

The plan is low-to-medium complexity, requires no database changes, and maintains full backward compatibility while significantly improving the user experience.
