# Implementation Plan for Issue #30: Add Info Balloons to Admin Forms

## Overview

This plan details the implementation of info balloons for all fields in the administrator forms. The goal is to provide helpful descriptions for each field to guide the administrator.

- **Issue:** [#30](https://github.com/mws/yeoldeartoonist.com/issues/30)
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Success Criteria:**
    - An info icon appears next to each field label in all admin forms.
    - Hovering over the icon reveals a tooltip (info balloon) with a description of the field.
    - The solution is implemented in a clean and maintainable way.

## Technical Approach

The core of the approach is to create a reusable `InfoBalloon` component that can be easily integrated into the existing admin forms.

- **Component-Based:** A new `InfoBalloon` component will be created in `src/components/ui/`.
- **Styling:** The component will be styled using Tailwind CSS to match the existing design system.
- **Integration:** The `InfoBalloon` component will be manually added to each of the four identified admin forms:
    1.  `src/components/admin/AdminForm.tsx`
    2.  `src/components/admin/artwork/ArtworkForm.tsx`
    3.  `src/components/admin/EventForm.tsx`
    4.  `src/components/admin/ProjectForm.tsx`
- **No Refactoring:** To minimize risk and complexity, the existing form implementations (one with `useState` and three with `react-hook-form`) will not be refactored.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create the `InfoBalloon` Component (TDD)

- **(RED)** Create a test file `__tests__/components/ui/InfoBalloon.test.tsx` that tests for the following:
    - The component renders an info icon.
    - The component displays the provided description text when hovered over.
- **(GREEN)** Create the `InfoBalloon.tsx` component in `src/components/ui/`.
    - It will accept a `description` prop.
    - It will use a simple `<span>` or `<div>` with an SVG icon for the trigger.
    - The tooltip will be a styled `<div>` that appears on hover.
- **(REFACTOR)** Ensure the component is simple, reusable, and follows project conventions.

### Step 2: Integrate `InfoBalloon` into `AdminForm.tsx`

- **(RED)** Update `__tests__/components/admin/AdminForm.test.tsx` to check for the presence of the info balloon on one of the fields.
- **(GREEN)** Modify `src/components/admin/AdminForm.tsx`:
    - Import the `InfoBalloon` component.
    - Create a descriptions object to store the help text for each field.
    - Add the `<InfoBalloon>` component next to each field's `<label>`.
- **(REFACTOR)** Review the changes for clarity and consistency.

### Step 3: Integrate `InfoBalloon` into `ArtworkForm.tsx`

- **(RED)** Update `__tests__/components/admin/artwork/ArtworkForm.test.tsx` to check for the presence of the info balloon.
- **(GREEN)** Modify `src/components/admin/artwork/ArtworkForm.tsx`:
    - Import the `InfoBalloon` component.
    - Create a descriptions object.
    - Add the `<InfoBalloon>` component to each field's `<label>`.
- **(REFACTOR)** Ensure consistency with the other forms.

### Step 4: Integrate `InfoBalloon` into `EventForm.tsx`

- **(RED)** Update `__tests__/components/admin/EventForm.test.tsx` to check for the presence of the info balloon.
- **(GREEN)** Modify `src/components/admin/EventForm.tsx`:
    - Import the `InfoBalloon` component.
    - Create a descriptions object.
    - Add the `<InfoBalloon>` component to each field's `<label>`.
- **(REFACTOR)** Review for consistency.

### Step 5: Integrate `InfoBalloon` into `ProjectForm.tsx`

- **(RED)** Update `__tests__/components/admin/ProjectForm.test.tsx` to check for the presence of the info balloon.
- **(GREEN)** Modify `src/components/admin/ProjectForm.tsx`:
    - Import the `InfoBalloon` component.
    - Create a descriptions object.
    - Add the `<InfoBalloon>` component to each field's `<label>`.
- **(REFACTOR)** Final consistency check.

## Verification Process

After each step, the following commands will be run:

1.  `tsc --noEmit`
2.  `npx eslint --fix {files}`
3.  `npx prettier --write {files}`
4.  `npx vitest related run {files}`

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Each component modification will be accompanied by unit tests to verify the new functionality.
- **Manual Testing:** After implementation is complete, manual testing will be performed on all admin forms to ensure the info balloons are working as expected and the UI is not broken.

## Considerations

- **Security:** No security implications are expected from this change.
- **Performance:** The performance impact is negligible.
- **Database:** No database changes are required.
- **Documentation:** The info balloons themselves serve as documentation for the admin forms. No other documentation updates are needed.
